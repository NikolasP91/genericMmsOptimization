"""Operating-state variables, transition arcs, and active timing constraints.

This module builds the operating-state part of the unit-commitment model. It
does three different jobs:

1. It creates one binary variable for every unit, interval, and operating
   state. Exactly one operating state must be selected for each unit in each
   modeled dispatch interval.
2. It restricts how units may move between operating states by using the
   transition graph defined in the input JSON.
3. It adds the accepted timing constraints: one unit-level minimum on/off time
   constraint and three operating-state transition timing constraints.

The suffixes used in the input names follow the project convention:

* ``_a`` timing is source-side timing. It protects the state being left.
* ``_b`` timing is destination-side timing. It protects the state being entered.
* ``_left`` timing represents residual time already owed at the beginning of
  the optimization horizon because the unit entered that state before period 1.

    For each generating unit, each dispatch interval, and each operating state

    * fixes the initial operating state at ``t = 0`` from the ``isEnabled``

    This function implements the operating-state transition constraint driven by
    the input fields ``max-transition-time_b`` and
    ``max-transition-time-left_b``. It is called "B-side" because the timing
    limit applies to the destination operating state of an allowed transition:
    after a unit enters destination state ``B`` from source state ``A``, it must
    not remain in ``B`` longer than the allowed number of dispatch periods.

    Two cases are modeled:

    * ``max-transition-time-left_b`` covers the beginning of the horizon. It is
      used when the unit was already in the destination state before the
      optimization horizon started and some maximum-time obligation remains.
    * ``max-transition-time_b`` covers transitions that occur inside the
      optimization horizon. Whenever the model moves from ``A`` at ``t - 1`` to
      ``B`` at ``t``, the unit may remain in ``B`` only for the specified number
      of periods.

    The constraints are soft. If the input data and other requirements make the
    timing rule impossible to satisfy, binary slack variables can relax the rule
    and the corresponding penalty terms are added to the objective:

    * ``s_max_oper_state_time_b_left`` for residual left-time violations;
    * ``s_max_oper_state_time_b_1`` for in-horizon maximum-time violations.

    """Add soft source-side minimum-time rules for operating-state transitions.

    This function implements the ``A`` part of the operating-state timing
    formulation. In a transition notation ``A -> B``, state ``A`` is the source
    operating state. The ``min-transition-time_a`` fields therefore protect the
    source side: once the model has entered or is still obligated to remain in
    source state ``A``, it should not leave ``A`` too early.

    Two related inputs are handled:

    * ``min-transition-time-left_a`` represents residual time that was already
      owed at the start of the horizon. It prevents an immediate transition out
      of the source state until that residual obligation is satisfied.
    * ``min-transition-time_a`` is the normal in-horizon minimum source-side
      time. If the unit enters source state ``A`` at interval ``t``, the model
      must keep the transition pattern consistent with staying in ``A`` for the
      required number of periods before moving to another operating state.

    The constraints are soft and use binary slack variables:

    * ``s_min_a_left`` relaxes residual source-side minimum-time obligations;
    * ``s_min_a_1`` relaxes in-horizon source-side minimum-time obligations.

    The function also appends a self-transition entry to each transition list so
    that "remaining in A" is treated consistently with moving from A to another
    listed destination.
